### Goals on the Tutorial
Hello reader! My goal is to show major parts of the framework with the examples and explanations as short, easy and fun as possible, so if you interested please come in!

### LÖVE
`LÖVE` is the framework for creating 2D games by using Lua language. It's pretty simple to use.

### Why to use LÖVE?
The framework can be perfecly fit for:

1. Prototyping - because of the language it's used and minimal work for installing and launching a working application just in few minutes

2. Lightweight - if you familiar with a big engines for game development like Unity than you anknowledged of installation process, configuring, and reading few articles, documentation or watching videos of how the interface work, how to set-up environment needed for you and whole bunch of other stuff. `LÖVE` is just installed and ready to go.

3. Portfolio - I think it's greate to have something to show in your portfolio website or in github that work even as a prototype of early stage.

4. Experience - most important for me is an experience you can get from the developing process by using small frameworks helps you better understand your own capabilities, where you struggle, where you will needed a help from an other people, to make design, music, scenario etc. With small start you will waste much, trust me, much less time if you will stuck on the middle of developing because of lacking some skills or understanding that choosen pack of technologies in the beginning wasn't quite right. Small and simple tools will save your time for future projects.

Finally it's free, which is mean that you can make profitable product and take all the money to yourself, but please not forget about the tool that help you, by donating to them, or contributing to their community. 

### What software used LÖVE?
