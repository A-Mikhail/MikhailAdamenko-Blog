### Tutorial Goals
Hello reader! My goal is to show major parts of the framework with the examples and explanations as short easy and fun as possible, so if you interested please come in!

### LÖVE
`LÖVE` is an *awesome* framework for creating 2D games by using Lua language. Both framework and language simple to use, the framework is open-source, and works on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Android and iOS as it cited in their [website](https://love2d.org).

### Why to use LÖVE?
The framework can be perfecly fit for:

1. __Prototyping__ --- because of the language it's used and minimal work for installing and launching a working application just in few minutes

2. __Lightweight__ --- if you familiar with game engines like Unity than you anknowledged about all problem that may occur in a process of installation and configuration for the first time. `LÖVE` is just installed and ready to go.

3. __Portfolio__ --- I think it's greate to have something to show in your portfolio website or in git even as a prototype of early stage product.

4. __Experience__ --- most important for me is an experience you can get from the developing process, by using a small frameworks helps you better understand your own capabilities, where you struggle, where you will needed a help from an other people, to make design, music, scenario and etc. With small start you will waste much, trust me, much less time if you will stuck on the middle of developing because of lacking some skills or instant understanding that choosen pack of technologies chosen at the beginning wasn't quite right. 

    Small and simple tools will save your time for future projects.

Finally it's free, which is mean that you can make profitable product and take all the money to yourself, but please not forget about the tool that help you, by donating to them or contributing to their community. 

### What software used LÖVE?
You can find it on their [main page](https://love2d.org/), but if you doesn't want to check it yourself:

1. `Mr. Rescue` by `Tangram Games`

An arcade styled 2d action game centered around evacuating civilians from burning buildings.

The game features fast paced fire extinguishing action, intense boss battles, a catchy soundtrack and lots of throwing people around in pseudo-randomly generated buildings.

2. `Move or Die` by `Those Awesome Guys`

An absurdly fast-paced, 4-player local and online party game where the mechanics change every 20 seconds. The very definition of a friendship-ruining game, Move or Die is easy to pick up but hard to put down.

And many more, big and small games builded by using LÖVE.

### Background
For easy usage of `LÖVE` and `Lua` you won't need match to know, usefull knowledge will be have is:

1. Understanding of one of the programming languages, or knowledge of loops, arrays, variables, functions, OOP will be useful to know for large projects.
2. Work with the Window or Unix console/terminal commands, simple --- install/uninstall programs, creating/deleting files/folders, etc. Nothing special need to know.
3. Familiarity with IDE or notepad on your chose for syntax highlight, git integration, debugging etc.

### Let's Try It Out
Now, when you have some knowledge about the framework, we can take our first steps to the [framework](https://mikhailadamenko.design/love/2018-03-06-Chapter-1-installing-and-launching.html).

### Lua
If you interested in learning syntax of Lua before moving next there has one great article --- [Learn X in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua/)
